## The Eastman Computer Music Center Archive

The Eastman Computer Music Center as it was until Allan Schindler's death in 2019 no longer exists. In an effort to preserve the memory of the center and the work that was done there from 1981 until the ECMC became EARS (2020?) and then EMuSE (2023) we collect and make public all of the resources available as well as historical documentation of important events such as the 25th Anniversary concert season of 2006. Some of this is still available at the old ECMC page (http://ecmc.rochester.edu/ecmc25/home25.html), but for how much longer it exists is uncertain.

SFLIB, a collection of sound samples in both 44.1k and 96k variants that were part of the core working environment at ECMC have been uploaded to repositories here:

https://github.com/scottericpetersen/sflib96

In the future, it is possible these will be merged into this repository and associated with computer software and other resources from the historical ECMC.
